# Dependency Document

## Overview
This project relies on several key open-source libraries to perform Computer Vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Core Dependencies

### 1. OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- **Purpose**: Image pre-processing and manipulation.
- **Usage**: Loading images, converting to grayscale, denoising, adaptive thresholding, and drawing redaction boxes.
- **Version**: Headless version is used to avoid GUI dependency issues in server environments.

### 2. EasyOCR (`easyocr`)
- **Purpose**: Optical Character Recognition.
- **Usage**: Extracting text from handwritten document images. It uses deep learning models (CRAFT for detection, CRNN for recognition).
- **Note**: Configured to run on CPU (`gpu=False`) for broad compatibility, but supports CUDA.

### 3. Microsoft Presidio (`presidio-analyzer`, `presidio-anonymizer`)
- **Purpose**: PII Identification and Redaction.
- **Usage**:
    - `presidio-analyzer`: Analyzes text to find entities like PERSON, DATE_TIME, PHONE_NUMBER, etc.
    - `presidio-anonymizer`: Replaces detected PII in text with placeholders.
- **Backend**: Uses `spaCy` NLP models.

### 4. Spacy (`spacy`)
- **Purpose**: NLP engine for Presidio.
- **Model**: `en_core_web_lg` (Large English model) is required for better entity recognition accuracy.

### 5. NumPy (`numpy`)
- **Purpose**: Array manipulation.
- **Usage**: Handling image data arrays for OpenCV.

## Installation
To install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```
